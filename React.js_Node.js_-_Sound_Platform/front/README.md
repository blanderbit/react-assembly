# notes

These files are attached to the static site, and should be replaced with better code:

*  assets/bootstrap/
*  assets/css/
*  assets/font-icons/
*  assets/images/ (all but generic-cover_200x200.png)
*  assets/js/

Basically, all but these folders in assets/:


*  favicon.ico
*  apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
*  images/generic-cover_200x200.png
*  fonts/
*  svg/


These are attached to the new app, and used to be built into ../generated using brunch:

*  js/
*  less/
