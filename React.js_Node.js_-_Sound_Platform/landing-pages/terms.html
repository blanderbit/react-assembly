                          <li>You may revoke your contract statement within two weeks without stating reasons in text form (e.g. letter, email). The period begins upon receipt of this information in text form, however not before conclusion of the contract and not before fulfillment of our information obligations according to section 312c paragraph 2 BGB (German Civil Code) in combination with section 1 paragraphs 1,2, and 4 BGB - InfoV (German Civil Code Freedom of Information Law) as well as our obligations according to section 312e paragraph 1 clause 1 BGB in combination with article 246 section 3 EGBGB (Introductory Act to the German Civil Code). The period of revocation shall be deemed fulfilled if the revocation is sent timely. Revocation shall be addressed to: Spherz GmbH, Kirchenstrasse 72, 81675 Munich, Germany.</li>
                          <li>Consequences of Revocation<br>In case of effective revocation, the services received by either side shall be returned and any utilization (e.g. interest) shall be handed over. If you cannot return or issue the payment or benefits received (benefits of use) or can only do so partially or in a deteriorated conditions, you shall pay us compensation in this respect. This may result in the consequence that you will have to fulfill your contractual payment obligations for the period up to revocation. Obligations concerning refund of payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. For you, the period begins when you send your declaration of revocation; for us it begins when we receive it.</li>
                          <li>Special Information<br>In case of a service your right of revocation will expire prematurely if the contract has been fulfilled by both parties at your request before you have exercised your right of revocation. If you are an entrepreneur in the sense of section 14 BGB (German Civil Code) and are acting in the scope of your commercial or independent activity when concluding the contract, right of revocation does not apply.</li>

                          <li>Spherz provides Internet based POS (i.e. Point-of-Sales&rdquo;) music for businesses. The free trial requires registration of the customer to Spherz. After 30 days of trial, the customers can continue to use the service, which is then subject to a fee. The service provides the POS with intelligent music: each song is played as the output of a computation performed by Soundsuit cloud-based algorithms. The algorithm selects from Soundsuit music catalogue the right song, to be played at the right time, at the POS of the customer. Different criterias are used to select the optimum song: business type, time of the day, season, geographical location of the POS, age group of clients at POS, music direction wished by customers, favorite music pieces indicated by customer, etc.</li>
                          <li>The service can provide the customer with the option to interrupt the broadcast by pressing the pause key or to skip the currently played song to get the next one. The service is not installed in a way that the customer is provided broadcasts of tracks of specific artists or albums. The customer has no claim to these functions.</li>
                          <li>Spherz has the right to use effective technical measures that are designed to prevent the customer from automatically scanning the soundtracks so as to filter certain music tracks from the soundtracks and/or generating copies of the music tracks.</li>

                          <li>Spherz shall be liable for damage caused by it or its simple agents for minor negligence – even outside the contract – only if an obligation is violated whose observation is of special significance for achieving the purpose of the contract (cardinal obligation) as well as in cases of damages arising from death, and injury to body or health. In the event of violation of a cardinal obligation, liability shall be limited to such damages that are typically foreseeable in the scope of this agreement, except in cases of intent or gross negligence or if liability is mandatory due to damages arising from death, and injury to body or health. Liability according to the product liability law shall remain unaffected.</li>
                          <li>Spherz shall not be liable for damages that are controllable by the customer or damages that the customer may have prevented by taking reasonable measures. In the event of data loss, Spherz shall be liable only in the amount of the reconstruction effort incurred with backup copies available. The customer is hereby informed explicitly that he is responsible for making backup copies regularly and to a sufficient degree. Therefore, Spherz shall not provide compensation for loss of data. Spherz is committed to protect all customers with the care common to the industry. However, Spherz shall not be subjected to claims for damages incurred by data espionage, hacker attacks, faulty hardware or software or acts of God.</li>
                          <li>Change of the burden of proof at the customer’s disadvantage is not connected to the above provisions.</li>
                          <li>Spherz dissociates itself explicitly from the contents of any pages that are referenced directly or indirectly (by so-called links) from Spherz's website. Spherz does not assume liability for these contents and sites. The providers of such pages are responsible for their content. By judgment of May 12th 1998 (case number 312 O 85/98), the Twelfth Civil Chamber of the Hamburg District Court decided that parties who publish a link may have to accept co-responsibility for the contents of the linked page. According to the District Court, this can only be prevented by explicitly distancing oneself from these contents. As the Internet site <a href="http://www.soundsuit.fm">www.soundsuit.fm</a> (&rdquo;Soundsuit&rdquo;) also contains links, Spherz GmbH explicitly distances itself from the contents of the linked pages. This declaration applies to all links published on the Internet site and for all the contents of the pages to which links or banners direct the user.</li>
